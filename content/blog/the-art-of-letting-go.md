There's a moment every engineering leader hits — usually somewhere between managing 15 and 50 people — where you realize you physically cannot review every pull request, attend every design review, or weigh in on every architectural decision. And more importantly, you shouldn't.

## The Identity Crisis

When you were an IC, your value was measured by the code you shipped. As a manager, your value is measured by the code *your team* ships. As a VP, your value is measured by whether the *organization* can ship without you in the room.

That's a hard transition. It means the thing that got you here — your technical judgment, your ability to see around corners, your instinct for the right abstraction — needs to be *taught*, not *applied*.

## The Practical Framework

I've found a simple framework for deciding when to delegate:

1. **If someone on your team can do it 70% as well as you** — delegate it immediately
2. **If it's a growth opportunity for someone** — delegate it and invest in coaching
3. **If it requires your specific positional authority** — do it yourself, but document the decision
4. **If it's a one-way door decision** — stay involved, but let someone else drive

The 70% rule is the one that trips people up. "But I could do it better!" Yes, probably. But you doing it better means you're not doing the five other things only you can do. And that person never gets the reps they need to get to 90%.

## What Changes When You Let Go

The first time I truly delegated a major architecture decision, I was terrified. My team chose a different approach than I would have. And you know what? It worked fine. Actually, it worked better in some ways I hadn't considered.

That's when it clicked: my job isn't to make every decision right. It's to build a team that makes good decisions consistently, even when I'm not there.

The irony of leadership is that your greatest impact often comes from the things you *don't* do.
