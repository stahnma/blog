Product-led growth has been the buzzword of the last several years, and for good reason — when it works, it's a flywheel that compounds. But most writing about PLG comes from the product and marketing side. Here's what it looks like from engineering.

## The Instrumentation Tax

The first thing you learn about PLG is that it's data-hungry. You need to know where users drop off, what features drive activation, and which behaviors predict conversion. This means your engineering team needs to treat instrumentation as a first-class concern, not an afterthought.

In practice, this means:

- Event tracking is part of the definition of done
- Your data pipeline is as important as your application
- Engineers need to understand the metrics they're instrumenting, not just fire events into the void

## Speed as a Feature

In a PLG model, your product *is* your marketing. That means performance, onboarding UX, and time-to-value aren't nice-to-haves — they're your conversion funnel. I've seen teams obsess over landing page copy while their app takes 8 seconds to load. The fastest path to PLG success is often just making the product faster.

## The Self-Serve Mindset

Traditional enterprise sales can paper over rough edges with white-glove onboarding. PLG can't. Every confusing error message, every missing integration, every "contact sales for pricing" is a user who bounces.

Engineering for PLG means building with empathy for a user who has no context, no training, and no patience. It's harder than it sounds.
