Over the last few months, I've been working in small groups on devops implementations. People often ask something along the lines of, "How do I make forward progress on anything with all these fires burning?" This is a difficult position, but is also likely the genesis of why you're trying to learn about new ways of working. My simple answer: Let it burn.

There are emergencies and problems. They were there yesterday, and will be there tomorrow. If all you're doing is reacting to those problems, you're not really improving anything. You're making sure the minimum viable service stays minimum, and if you're lucky, it stays viable. Teams that operate in this mode are used as scapegoats for other problems, as they can't defend themselves while firefighting. They suffer from burnout, because people aren't improving at their jobs. Individuals feel like they will let the company down if they don't put in extra effort and extinguish one last problem.

> You're not letting the company down. The company is letting you down.

When I was fresh out of school, working as a system administrator on Linux and AIX, I worked 10–12 hour days nearly all the time. I didn't mind: I was learning the environment, figuring out how things worked, and I had never even heard of a thing called [burnout](http://burnout.io/en/latest/). I remember after several weeks of this, and a few nice projects delivered, a co-worker came to talk to me. He said, "Mike, you need to stop working so much." I disregarded this advice. I was still enjoying what I was doing. Honestly, I felt like the only person who enjoyed our job. Everybody else was crotchety, jaded, and very cynical. I didn't get it.

A few months passed. The same coworker came to me and said again that I needed to stop working so much. This time, it was a longer conversation. I'm sure lots of things were covered that I still couldn't grasp being less than year into the job. But one argument stuck with me. "We're a team of 6 right? If we all work 2 hours extra every day, that's a person-and-a-half worth of free labor for the company. What's worse, that becomes the expectation for us, and we won't get new staff or other resources when we need it." I remember countering with something along the lines of "Yes, but there's all this work to do. It's just a bubble and once we…" He cut me off and said, "There is no bubble. There's never a bubble. You'll think that, and then realize workloads and expectations expand to fit the shape of the container."

I wish I could say that after that conversation, I immediately changed my behaviors and learned a lesson. I didn't. I often have to learn things the hard way.

Now, how does this relate to the fires we have today? When you're saying you don't have time to learn or automate, what you're actually saying is "We don't have time to not learn, or not automate." If you automated something that took you only 90 minutes a week, you'd get 90 minutes to do something more enjoyable. Will it take you a long time to automate that 90 minute set of tasks? Maybe. You get that time by choosing a few fires, and just letting them burn.

Letting a fire burn also can help tell a story. Maybe you need different people on your team. Maybe you need more people. Maybe the stacks or software you're supporting are actually terrible, and the other teams need to be held accountable for their gasoline-doused deployments.

I'm not qualified to tell you what fire to let burn. Some are less problematic than others. Perhaps some burn hottest only at the end of the month, or on Tuesdays. Perhaps the person who always complains about something is on holiday. Either way, select an area you can cordon off, and let that fire rage. It might be your first step toward actual progress.

I'm not one of those people who just wants to watch the world burn, most of the time. I know firefighters literally controls fires with fire, and that metaphor applies here as well. So, how do you make time to examine your practices and improve? How do you start your devops transformation? Let it burn.
