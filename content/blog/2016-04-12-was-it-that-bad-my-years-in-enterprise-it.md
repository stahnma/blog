I spent nine years in enterprise IT at a company with more than 100,000 people and 50 billion in revenue. I often act as though it was terrible and the worst place on Earth. At times, it certainly felt like it. There were other times where I enjoyed my job as much as I've enjoyed any role I've had, anywhere. For as much as I complain about the land of enterprise, I learned some great things there. Today, I'm going to talk about what enterprise IT was really good at.

I'll be comparing and contrasting enterprise IT and the tech sector. I define enterprise IT as a very large (20,000 employees or more), publicly traded company where IT is not their primary function (though honestly, even if IT was their primary function, I doubt my insights would change). When I say Tech Sector, I mean companies clearly in the technology vertical, and probably something much smaller than 20,000 people. It could be a startup, or established technology company.

My experiences here are mainly drawn from two companies I've worked at. I've definitely heard stories that corroborate the anecdotes I'll cover, but that doesn't necessarily mean this will directly match your experiences.

### **Hiring**

In the enterprise IT space, you hire based on potential. My former company hired people with the ambiguously accurate job title of _IT Analyst_. The title was as generic as it sounds, and covered a wide range of skills. A person with that title could be a Windows Server Administrator, an SAP developer, a security policy author, or anything in between. Interestingly enough, that person would nearly always be required to change roles (keeping their job title) in two to three years. That means you need to hire somebody based not on what they know today, but what you think they can learn and do in the future.

This is totally different than what I see in the technology space. In my experience in the tech sector, and from watching other organizations from afar, people in tech want their unicorn. Tech wants to hire the exact right person, like the full-stack developer with years of experience on a dozen technologies. They want somebody who has basically done the exact same job somewhere else already.

Do you ever wonder why salaries are so high in the tech sector? If you wanted me to leave one job to do the same job somewhere else, where I have less tenure and credibility, you'd have to pay me a whole lot more. In other words, hiring in tech has been much less about what you could do, but what you've already done.

I don't want to do the same job again, I want to grow and learn. I'd argue that hiring based on potential has many benefits. There's basically nothing more rewarding to me than having an entry-level worker learn, succeed, execute, be promoted and do great work. The teams I've built at Puppet are a great mix of entry-level folk and experienced people.

### **Career Growth**

In the enterprise space, because a person is hired on potential, career growth and development are paramount. You have to help people reach their potential. My former company did a great job of teaching people what a project was, and how to manage it. They sent people to classes on project management, and gave plenty of chances to to apply those lessons. This includes how to deal with dependencies on projects, and how to communicate changes to status on them. Those are wonderful, foundational skills to have. Those skills also provided some opportunity to lead people — whether on small tasks, large projects or in cross-functional teams.

We certainly had to take some required classes that I wouldn't wish upon anybody, such as _Using Microsoft Project 102,_ or [_The Fish Philosophy_](http://www.fishphilosophy.com/). However, the investment in me from my managers and other leaders in the company was terrific. Early on in my career, I had three managers who I could talk to about anything, and I learned an enormous amount from them. Later in my tenure there, I was in a formal mentorship program (as the mentee), giving me access to build relationships (and get lunches) with a director completely from different department. It was a fresh perspective.

When I expressed interest in being a leader, my boss basically gave me a management boot camp. I had literal homework. My assignments included reading and reporting out on assigned books, coming up with diagrams of functions of my team's areas of responsibility, the roles and inputs from adjacent areas, etc. At the time, that seemed pretty hectic, but it paid off quickly. I have no idea how many hours we spent in my manager's office getting one-on-one training — listening to him teach me things, ask me questions, and having him honestly trying to help me get better.

I certainly didn't always appreciate it at the time. Sometimes, I thought he was pretty nuts. I also wondered what work he did if it was all being handed to me. Since then, I've been very glad I had to handle so much responsibility. Those lessons were invaluable. Today, I work with a few other folks who worked with him. Whenever I utter the phrase, "Do you have a minute for me?" we know it's time for a 1:1 to do some management on-the-job training.

### **Lifecycles**

In enterprise IT, there are two lifecycles and forces battling each other: The technology and the people. With the technology, there is no such thing as temporary. I was on dozens of projects over my time there to retire a technology — Solaris 8, all HPUX, Veritas Netbackup, Remedy, and lots of other tools. Those had been ostensibly replaced by a new thing/product. Our job was to rid the datacenter of those older, now sunset technologies. In nine years there, I can honestly say we got _zero_ of those projects 100% done. Not once did I see us turn off the last instance of a specific sunset technology item. This could be because audit requirements and regulations required something to stay around. It may have been that some factory machine needed this exact version of HPUX to run for the next 16 years. Either way, we reduced, but we didn't completely eliminate.

People, on the other hand, are ephemeral. They will change jobs. They will have different bosses. They will care about different objectives. When a project isn't going well, people will transfer out. New leaders will come in and that project will either get canned or rebooted. Let me assure you, there are lessons to be learned when your personnel is constantly changing. You learn automated process are required, especially with stellar documentation and built-in debuggability. You know the things you're doing today aren't just for future you. This often means solutions and process need to be easy to understand, and not very technically complex. This can be quite the set of handcuffs on getting work done. But if you're able to get a process working and automated for consumption by just about anybody, it will last a very long time. I know my former company still does a decent amount of it's server asset, compliance and configuration management based on a process I coded up in 2003.

### **Budgets**

Solving technology problems is hard. In the enterprise sector, companies spend money on software from big players. In the technology sector, companies spend big money on great people.

I had the chance to manage a budget between 6–12 million dollars, depending on the year — and that was just for capital spend. That's for things like servers, storage, backups, infrastructure software (VMware ESX, Satellite) and disaster recovery. It didn't need to cover networks, telephony, applications, or things like that. It was pretty awesome. I got to work on storage networks and VMware farms at sizes I probably won't see again. When you're doing that, you are thinking about scale, but not the same way you think about scale when people talk about Facebook or Netflix. You're thinking about keeping services online, but you might manage infrastructure that serves out hundreds of applications. These aren't microservices, but could actually be hundreds of monoliths each designed to do something like run an HR system, allow a customer to purchase used/refurbished equipment, internal email, build parts on a factory floor, inventory management and more. When we wanted to make changes, we had to figure out a plan to roll them out across a fleet that was about as heterogeneous as you could imagine. It was a scale problem, just not a number of servers scale — more a number of variables scale.

### **Closing**

I wanted to offer up a reminder to myself and others that there are great things about enterprise IT. I think the soft-skills areas were especially well done where I worked. Much of this was because I've been spending time reflecting on career growth and development for team members, myself and people working near me now. It feels a little weird to say good things about Enterprise, as in general, it was a culture-clash for me. The freedom of startup and technology culture is a better match for me. However, I'm glad I spent some time learning there. Do my findings match yours in the enterprise space? I'd love to hear your thoughts, on Medium or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stahnma).
