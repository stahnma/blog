I'm excited to announce I'm joining [CircleCI](https://www.circleci.com) as VP of Platform. I'll be heading up SRE, Security, and Internal Tooling. I've been involved in the operational side of development for the last 8 years, building out packaging, testing, pipeline and deployment systems, and then managing the people who did that. I'm excited to stay in that space, and to offer CI/CD tooling as a service.

I've enjoyed making system administrators more productive, and look forward to applying those principles to developers and software teams at companies of all sizes. I'm excited to meet new people, new customers, and use some technology that I haven't really had serious chances to play with (Nomad, K8s).

Prior to my interview, I sat down to use the product. I knew I couldn't work for a company whose product I didn't believe in. I really like it. It's responsive, it's fast, and it's able to better map to workflows and workloads than other tools in the space. It's not just a fancy test runner. The combination of the technology side (including things like [Orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs/)) and their openness on [hiring](https://circleci.com/blog/how-to-get-hired-at-circleci/) [practices](https://circleci.com/blog/what-we-ve-learned-about-hiring-engineering-managers/) and [job levels](https://circleci.com/blog/why-we-re-designed-our-engineering-career-paths-at-circleci/), demonstrated CircleCI had a great mix of things I wanted moving forward with my career.

Beyond the technology, I'll get more exposure to running a company as an executive, and working with the board and our investors. CircleCI is growing quickly right now, so I'll get to apply several lessons from my previous time at Puppet. Growth is exciting, and so is having some experience to draw from.

I'm staying in Madison WI, as our team is largely distributed. (I have one person based in SF, where the HQ is). The interview experience was entirely on video calls and over the phone.

I'm sure I'll have more to say once I actually roll into the office for orientation and exec meetings, and have a better feeling for where this is all going. Until then, I'm excited for what the future holds.
