After 8 years at Puppet, I've left. This is scary. This is a big deal to me, and probably to some other folks. Puppet has been a huge part of my life, and always will be. I didn't leave because I think it sucks, or has no future. I left for a new opportunity that excites me and gives me a chance to learn new things. (More on that later).

When I look back at Puppet and 8 years, there's a whole lot to reflect upon and laugh about, smile about, cry about, and be proud of. First off, thanks to everybody who I worked with at Puppet. I learned something from all of you. I learned from users, customers, developers, haters, marketers, sales teams, operators… everybody. I'll share a few things that are top of mind when I think about my accomplishments at Puppet.

#### Interns

I hired the first engineering intern at Puppet. He was awesome. I hired a few more. I started to build a program. Others folks ran with it and made it even better. There is nothing more exciting to me than hiring interns. They're fresh faces, full of energy, and eager to learn. They have a positive attitude stepping into a new industry or role because everything is in front of them. Cynicism hasn't set in yet. What they sometimes lack in skill, they make up for with effort, their desire to improve, and application of distinct life experiences. It's the best. At Puppet, I interviewed probably more than 60, hired around half of them, and then hired the majority of our interns as full-time employees. Those converted interns were and still are some Puppet's best employees. It's a great way to build a department, to scale, and to improve everything about your workplace. Some companies think interns are too much work. You're wrong. I can't stress this enough. Injection of new energetic folks who want to learn and work hard is awesome. I'm proud of the program I helped build for Puppet.

#### Security

When I got to Puppet, I owned product security. I'm not exactly sure how that happened, and I don't remember it being a formal handover to me or anything. Apparently, release engineering just does security, and so I did. I am quite proud of the security track record for Puppet. Yes, the software and the dependencies and adjacent tools have had many CVEs over the years. That's because we were constantly reviewing our code, reviewing our dependencies and libraries, subscribing to newsletters and other feeds, and just trying to take care of security the best we could. We built process around responsible/coordinated disclosure. We did embargoes with Linux/BSD distributions to ensure users were protected quickly. We derailed backlogs of features when high-priority security items were discovered. We engaged third parties to pen test our software and whitebox/blackbox attack it. I think Puppet did (and still does) an excellent job at security patching, and patching all supported streams on the same day. It's hard work, and I'm really happy we worked so hard on that space. The security practices of Puppet are built on integrity, and I think it shows.

#### Interviewing

I have done so many interviews. You don't go from a company of 35 to 515 without interviewing a lot of folks to support and sustain that growth. I estimate I have done more than 350 in-person interviews. I'm not sure on the exact number; it could be 500 and I wouldn't be shocked. For about a two-year period, I was doing 2+ interviews a day, 5 days a week, for months on end. I got a whole lot better at interviewing. I was able to ask open-ended questions, steer discussion, cut off long answers to learn more, dig deeper for specific answers, and make decisions. This is the skill that is probably most transferable for the rest of my career. I've [spoken](https://speakerdeck.com/stahnma/what-ive-learned-interviewing-more-than-200-people-face-to-face?slide=2) a [few times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKX6nhcbsmw) at conferences about interviewing now. It's really fun to get to practice and iterate on interviewing to improve, and I'm lucky enough to have been given those opportunities. I'll probably write a whole lot more about this in the future.

#### Attrition

My first 6 years as manager at Puppet, I didn't have anybody who reported directly to me quit. Part of that is how awesome Puppet was. Part of that was how much fun we had. Part of that (I'd like to think) was me doing at least a decent job as a manager. I doubt I'll ever get a period like this again in my career.

#### Fun

I tried to interweave having fun while working with Puppet from Day One. I like to have fun. I think having fun while working means better work. Some of this is empowering others (that's fun!) some is working on chat bots, or building the beer inventory and menu system ([http://puppet.com/beer](http://puppet.com/beer)), or internal org chart tooling. I enjoy building helpful tools and just having a good time. To this day, I can't hear "Regulate" and not think of a late night spent preparing to ship PE 2.0 with a few of us in the office blasting '90s hip hop and one-hit wonders.

Anyway. It's been 8 years at Puppet. It's been a wild ride that I appreciate more than I could possibly express in words. I may not be employed by Puppet after April 1, but I'll still be Puppet AF.
