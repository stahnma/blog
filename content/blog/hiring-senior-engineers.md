After hundreds of interviews, I've developed some opinions about what actually matters when hiring senior engineers. Most of it isn't what you'd expect from a typical job posting.

## Technical Skill is Table Stakes

Yes, senior engineers need to be technically strong. But by the time someone has 8+ years of experience, the difference between "good" and "great" technically is much smaller than the difference between "communicates well" and "can't explain their thinking."

## What Actually Differentiates

**Judgment over knowledge.** I care less about whether you know the answer and more about how you reason when you don't. Do you ask good questions? Do you identify constraints? Do you know when to stop digging and make a pragmatic choice?

**Ownership mentality.** When something breaks at 2am, do you fix it and go back to bed, or do you fix it *and* write the post-mortem *and* file the ticket for the systemic fix? Senior engineers don't just solve problems — they prevent future ones.

**Teaching instinct.** The highest-leverage thing a senior engineer can do is make everyone around them better. I look for evidence that they've mentored, documented, or upleveled their team.

**Comfort with ambiguity.** Junior engineers need clear requirements. Senior engineers should be comfortable with "we're not sure what the right approach is yet" and be able to drive toward clarity.

## The Interview Red Flag

The biggest red flag? When a candidate can't name a decision they got wrong and what they learned from it. Everyone makes bad calls. The senior engineers own them and grow.
