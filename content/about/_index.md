I'm a VP of Engineering who's spent a career at the intersection of engineering, product, and growth. I've built teams, shipped products, given talks, and written things down along the way.

My background spans infrastructure and DevOps, platform engineering, and product development. I've been an IC who loved the terminal, a manager who learned to love spreadsheets, and an executive who learned to love ambiguity.

## What I Write About

- **Engineering leadership** — the hard parts of managing people who are smarter than you
- **Platform engineering** — building internal tools and infrastructure that developers actually want to use
- **Product-led growth** — what happens when your product is your go-to-market motion
- **Career stuff** — the IC-to-VP path and everything in between
