I'm a technology executive focused on turning engineering into business outcomes. I lead at the intersection of engineering, product, marketing, and growth.

Across startup and scale-up environments, I've helped grow engineering organizations from single digits to hundreds of engineers, improved gross margins, and built more reliable platforms for enterprise customers. I've also served as interim Head of Product and interim Head of Marketing, helping connect roadmap, go-to-market, and customer adoption.

My background spans DevOps, platform engineering, and product development. I've been an IC who loved the terminal, a manager who learned to love spreadsheets, and an executive who learned to love ambiguity.
